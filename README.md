# Can a complete beginner in Unity create a game using only ChatGPT?

## What did I make?
A simple player vs. computer tic-tac-toe game on Unity. Used OpenAI's GPT-4 (gpt-4-0314).

## Why did I make this?
To test ChatGPT's capabilities in teaching a complete beginner how to create games in the Unity environment.

My capabilities as a programmer was basic to intermediate at this stage. Unity uses C# as its scripting language. My background is in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and have previous experience in: Matlab, C, C++, Python, and Assembly.

## Results
There is a rudimentary tic-tac-toe game that can be played. Functioning buttons and appropriate feedback of `X`'s (player) and `O`'s (computer) to match. Win/lose/draw detection. When a game is finished, it clears the board and restarts after a few seconds.

The computer can determine when the player is about to win and can block intentionally.

The computer cannot determine when it is about to win. The computer only has a basic strategy - unless the player is about to win, place randomly.

## Method
1. Used OpenAI's gpt-4-0314. 

## Replication instructions

## Usage
1. Hit the Unity play button.
2. Click on the box to place an X. The computer responds with an O somewhere else on the board.
3. Once the game is over, wait a few seconds and the game will restart.
4. Press play again 

## Lessons
1. **Complex programs need to address token limitations**: Token limits meant more complex
